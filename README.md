# AI-FACE-MASK-DETECTION
Introduction: AI-Powered Face Mask Detection System
The project centres on creating a face mask detection system utilizing CNN and OpenCV for real-time surveillance in the use of AI. The goal is to automate checks of whether people wear masks that might otherwise require supervision in public places, workplaces and health care places.
Key Aspects of the Project:
Problem Addressed
•	The COVID-19 pandemic brought the necessity of wearing face masks into the limelight, however the mass enforcement of such masks is highly inefficient.
•	AI-powered solutions offer an accurate, scalable solution to compliance.
Methodology
•	Data Set: The Face Mask Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains images with or without masks.
•	Preprocessing: The images are resized to a fixed size, normalized, and augmented for better model generalization.
•	Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network based deep learning model is trained using TensorFlow and Keres to classify masked and unmasked faces.
•	Implemented it: Detected in real time with the help of OpenCV using a webcam, hence system is feasible to do real world deployment.
Results & Performance
•	Our model is trained and it provided us with 97% accuracy where we have a high precision and recall scores.
•	The real-time process detects faces and classifies whether a mask is being used in under 100 milliseconds per frame, a speedy process which can be utilized to monitor live footage.
•	Business & Practical Applications
•	Applicable in Security Cameras, Surveillance, Work Place and Public Areas for regulatory compliance
•	Minimizes human error and operational cost for an automated, scalable solution.
•	Future Improvements
•	Expanding dataset diversity (e.g., alternate mask types, lighting)
•	Transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet, etc.) to boost performance
•	Insights: Deploy on edge devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi) capable of low-power real time detection.
•	Expand the ability to detect when masks are worn incorrectly (e.g., mask below chin).
Final Thoughts
This is a great illustration of how AI can help tackle public health challenges. Hence, using deep learning and real-time processing, the system is an ideal accurate and scalable solution for realizing and controlling the wearing of masks. And with future improvements, it can do quite an efficient job and be a useful tool for monitoring public safety and public health.
